### **Solution and Approach for Fraud Detection Model**  

#### **📌 Introduction**  
Fraud detection is a crucial task in financial security, requiring accurate classification of transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. This project implements a **fraud detection model** using **machine learning algorithms** such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting**. The model is trained on a dataset of transaction records, incorporating **feature engineering, preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning** to enhance performance.

## **🚀 Solution Overview**  
The fraud detection system follows a structured machine learning pipeline:  

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:**  
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas` and preprocessed to handle missing values.  
   - Unnecessary columns such as names, addresses, and transaction timestamps are removed to maintain privacy.  

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - A new feature, `amt_segment`, is created to categorize transaction amounts into **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.  
   - The categorical variables are encoded using `LabelEncoder`.  

3. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - The dataset is split into **training** and **testing sets** (80-20 split).  
   - Feature scaling is applied using `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical variables.  

4. **Model Training:**  
   - Three machine learning models are trained:
     - **Logistic Regression** (Baseline Model)  
     - **Random Forest Classifier**  
     - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**  
   - Models are evaluated using **cross-validation (ROC-AUC scoring)**.  

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   - `GridSearchCV` is applied to optimize Random Forest and Gradient Boosting hyperparameters.  
   - Best hyperparameters are selected to improve model accuracy and fraud detection sensitivity.  

6. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Performance is assessed using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  
   - A **Confusion Matrix** is plotted to visualize fraud detection performance.  
   - Feature importance plots are generated to interpret the most influential transaction factors.
